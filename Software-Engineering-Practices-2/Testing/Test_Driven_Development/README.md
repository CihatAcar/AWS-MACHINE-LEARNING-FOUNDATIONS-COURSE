# Test-driven development and data science
* Test-driven development: Writing tests before you write the code that’s being tested. 
* Your test fails at first, and you know you’ve finished implementing a task when the test passes.
* Tests can check for different scenarios and edge cases before you even start to write your function. 
* When start implementing your function, you can run the test to get immediate feedback on whether it works or not as you tweak your function.
* When refactoring or adding to your code, tests help you rest assured that the rest of your code didn't break while you were making those changes. 
*  Tests also helps ensure that your function behavior is repeatable, regardless of external parameters such as hardware and time.
