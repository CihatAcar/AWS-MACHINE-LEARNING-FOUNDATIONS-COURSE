# How to write a modular code:
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself!)
* Abstract out logic to improve readability 
* Minimize the number of entities (functions, classes, modules, etc.)
* Functions should do one thing!
* Arbitrary variable names can be more effective in certain functions.
* Try to use fewer than three arguments per function.
