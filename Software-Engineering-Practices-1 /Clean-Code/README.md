# How to write a clean code:

* Use meaningful names.
	* Be descriptive and imply type
	* Be consistent but clearly differentiate 
	* Avoid abbreviations and especially single letters (Exception: counters and common math variables)
	* Long names != descriptive names
	* Use verbs for functions and nouns for variables
* Use whitespace properly
	* Organize your code with consistent indentation: the standard is to use four spaces for each indent. You can make this a default in your text editor.
	* Separate sections with blank lines to keep your code well organised and readable.
	*Try to limit your lines to around 79 characters, which is the guideline given in the PEP 8 style guide.
